#Communication Plan

To ensure clear and effective communication throughout this project, we’ve developed a strategy using Slack and Google Drive. For day-to-day communication and quick updates, we will use direct messaging through Slack. This will accommodate both of our work schedules while making sure we are both clear on project progress and our meeting deadlines. For more detailed conversations, such as conversations about overall project goals and task division, we will have calls as needed using the Slack huddle feature. This will allow us to resolve questions or set clear expectations quickly. Lastly, we’ve created a Google Drive folder where we can collaborate on progress reports and have quick access to resources needed for our project. Our goal with this strategy is to maximize transparency and collaboration while maintaining the flexibility to accommodate our schedules.
