Challenges

A technical challenge we face is that we know the general steps of how to complete this project, but we do not yet know all of the technologies or tools we might need. As we move through this project and this course, we will consider which tools best serve us. A potential challenge we could face regarding collaboration is that we both have jobs during the day, which may limit the amount of time we can work synchronously. To solve this, weâ€™ll need to have a clear communication and project management strategy. A third challenge is the disparity in coding experience between us since one group member is a developer professionally. This might create challenges when distributing technical tasks and making sure both group members participate equally in building this project. That being said, the other group member does have a background in mathematics, experience with emissions calculations, and limited coding experience. Addressing this imbalance will require thoughtful communication and potential additional learning on aspects of this project.
